# LunarSystem

A PHP/MySQL CMS (v0.8.50-alpha, circa 2006–2010) that models all content as **RDF triples** and renders pages through **XSLT transformations**. Originally developed by Odradek.

> ⚠️ **Study / experiment artifact — run it on `localhost` only.** This is alpha-grade
> 2006–2010 code revived for learning. It has bcrypt passwords, CSRF tokens,
> session-fixation defence, SQLi fixes, security headers, per-target admin authorization,
> an authenticated SPARQL proxy and a per-IP login throttle — but it ships with demo
> credentials and is not hardened for any networked deployment, so keep it on `localhost`
> and off the public internet. See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).
> The Docker stack binds every host port to `127.0.0.1` (and keeps the semantic-web
> services off the host entirely); **do not change that or otherwise expose `8080` /
> `3307` to a public or untrusted network.** It is not hardened for any networked or
> production deployment. See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).

> **An RDF-native Semantic Web CMS.** Beyond the archival CMS core, it is a *real* Semantic Web CMS: a frozen URI policy and a vocabulary mapping onto schema.org / Dublin Core / SIOC / FOAF / PROV-O, a JSON-LD projection, and a **triplestore-backed read/write loop**. Every content write mirrors into **Oxigraph** via SPARQL `UPDATE` (a generic write-through in the model's CRUD), and the read path (routing, access control, texts) is served **from the triplestore by default**, with MySQL as the system of record and an automatic SQL fallback (`?sparql=0` to bypass). The same SPARQL can also be served by **Ontop** (a virtual endpoint over the unchanged MySQL) with no app change. The untouched archival CMS is preserved on the **`legacy`** branch. See **[docs/linked-data.md](docs/linked-data.md)** for the full design and **[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md)** for what remains.

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Wait ~15 seconds for MySQL to initialise, then open **http://localhost:8080**.

> The Docker stack also starts a **triplestore** (Oxigraph) behind an authenticating reverse proxy (`sparql-proxy`) and a virtual **SPARQL endpoint** (Ontop), all on the internal compose network (no host port). The app reads and writes the triplestore through the proxy with credentials; the read path is served from it by default — append `?sparql=0` to any URL to read from MySQL instead, or set `SPARQL_ENDPOINT=http://ontop:8080/sparql` to read live through Ontop. See [docs/linked-data.md](docs/linked-data.md).

Log in as **`admin@lunarsystem.local`** with password **`luna`**. (These are demo credentials shipped in the seed data — change them before exposing the app anywhere.)

> **New here?** Follow the ~10-minute hands-on tour in **[docs/try-it.md](docs/try-it.md)**.

> MySQL is exposed on host port `3307` to avoid conflicts with a local MySQL on `3306`.

## Manual setup

Requirements: Apache 2 + `mod_rewrite`, **PHP 8.3** (the tested stack), MySQL 8.0, PHP extensions: `pdo_mysql`, `xsl`, `mbstring`, `gettext`.

1. Copy `luna/luna.domains/luna.default/ini/db.example.ini` → `db.ini` and fill in your credentials.  
   *(The file at `luna/luna.domains/luna.default/ini/db.ini` already contains Docker defaults.)*
2. Import `luna/luna.sql/luna.mysql.sql` into your MySQL database.
3. Ensure the `luna/luna.domains/<your-domain>/cache/` directory is writable by the web server.
4. The root `.htaccess` handles clean URL rewriting — confirm `AllowOverride All` is set in Apache.
5. Open the site in a browser.

### Domain configuration

The CMS detects the active domain by walking `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` and looking for a matching directory under `luna/luna.domains/`. If none is found it falls back to `luna/luna.domains/luna.default/`.

To add a site-specific config: create `luna/luna.domains/<hostname>/ini/luna.ini` and `db.ini`.

## Output formats

Append `?output=xml`, `?output=json`, `?output=n3`, or `?output=jsonld` to any page URL to receive the raw RDF model instead of HTML. (A JSON-LD block is also embedded in every HTML page's `<head>`; see [docs/linked-data.md](docs/linked-data.md).)

## Known issues

The major security issues are closed; an adversarial review graded the result
*ship-with-low-risk*. See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for the current posture and
verdict. The residual, by-design limitations:

| Issue | Impact | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Per-IP login throttle** | Security | Per-IP only (no per-account lockout, to avoid account enumeration); bypassable by IP rotation |
| **Ontop SPARQL is unauthenticated** | Security | The virtual (read-only) Ontop endpoint has no auth; it has no host port and stays on the internal compose network. Oxigraph's write endpoint is authenticated via `sparql-proxy` |
| **Legacy model / hardening residue** | Design | Unsalted MD5 hashes upgrade to bcrypt transparently on next login; flat group→level authz model |

The Docker stack boots cleanly on **PHP 8.3 + MySQL 8.0** (PDO). See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).
